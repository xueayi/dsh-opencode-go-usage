/**
 * OpenCode Go usage dock — the whole browser surface.
 *
 * A bottom-right floating dock: a compact glassy badge shows all three quota
 * windows (滚/周/月) with threshold-colored percentages plus the 5h-rolling
 * window's live reset countdown; clicking it toggles a glassy panel with the
 * full window rows, a manual refresh button, and clear error / unconfigured
 * states. The dock is mounted through a body portal by `client/index.tsx`
 * and follows DSH design tokens (`--dsw-alias-*`), so it blends with either
 * theme. Reuses the shared `StateDot` and `Button` primitives so the dock's
 * affordances stay visually consistent with the rest of DSH.
 * @module dsh-opencode-go-usage/client/dock

/**
 * Double ring for one quota window, shared by the collapsed badge (size 36)
 * and the expanded panel row (size 50). The outer ring is the used percent
 * (threshold-colored: green <60% / orange ≥60% / red ≥85%); the inner ring is
 * the share of the window period still left before its reset, drawn in the DS
 * brand tone (`--dsw-alias-state-business-primary`) and hugging the outer ring
 * with no visible gap so the two read as one bicolored band. Rounded caps
 * switch to butt at zero so a 0% window never shows a phantom arc, and the
 * dash transition tweens in for a smooth fill on refresh. Fixed SVG dimensions
 * keep the layout stable regardless of font fallback or zoom.
 * @param window - the projected quota window view (percent, reset, periodMs).
 * @param now - current epoch ms (drives the inner remaining-time arc).
 * @param size - outer diameter in px (50 for the panel, 36 for the badge).
